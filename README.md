### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Cody.

In a previous life, I created [gfxCardStatus](https://github.com/codykrieger/gfxCardStatus).

More recently, I've worked at Roku (senior software engineer on the audio team), Bowers &
Wilkins (lead platform engineer, software architect), and Apple (software engineer on
Safari/WebKit).

I'm currently working on some very cool new stuff that I hope to be able to share soon. ðŸ™‚
